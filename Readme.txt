This aims to be a dosbox-mountable c drive with a bunch of gamedev tools pre-installed
Hopefully the various software copyrights are old enough that the owners won't complain
In DosBox, run:
mount C /yourpath/DosDev
(add this line in the autoexec part of the dosbox.conf file: http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/AUTOEXEC)
